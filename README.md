# Emotional-recognition-
A Python project for classifying human emotions using image processing and machine learning.
# Emotional Recognition using Python  

This project was developed during my college as part of my coursework.  
The aim of the project is to detect and classify human emotions from images/videos using Python and machine learning.  

## Features
- Detects basic emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral.  
- Uses image processing and classification techniques.  
- Built with Python and popular ML libraries.  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- TensorFlow / Keras (for training the model)  

## How It Works
1. Preprocessed facial images.  
2. Extracted facial features using OpenCV.  
3. Trained a model using labeled datasets.  
4. Classified the emotion of the person in real-time or from images.  

## Results
- Successfully classified emotions with good accuracy on test data.  
- Demonstrated the potential of machine learning for emotion recognition.  

## Future Enhancements
- Add more emotion categories (Surprise, Fear, Disgust).  
- Improve accuracy with larger datasets.  
- Deploy as a web or mobile app.
